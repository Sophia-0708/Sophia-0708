# A Letter to Armonia Users

Dear Armonia users,

Hello, everyone! We are gathered here for the belief in and expectation for blockchain. Today, the number of active APLink users has exceeded 7 million and is still growing just over two months after Armonia's first eco-app APLink was activated.

Many consider that the blockchain industry is going through a period of chill in 2022, but the Armonia ecosystem is still running fast. Following the launch of APLink, another blockbuster app NFTONE, a completely decentralized distributed super DAO community, was launched on schedule in early July. Apollo, the first decentralized computing power trading platform developed based on smart contracts, will have a test run at the end of July and is scheduled to be launched in August. To put application scenarios into practice, Armonia ecosystem has a comprehensive layout planning, which will further improve and enrich Armonia ecosystem's cross-chain technology, market analysis, data board, social and media platforms and other functions. In the process of building Armonia ecosystem, we are pleased to see that more and more pioneers, peers and enthusiasts agree with open and win-win model of the blockchain industry. We also believe that blockchain technology can drive the unlimited potential in the future and develop steadily towards a promising future.

Based on the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind with DAO as the core leadership, the official website ([https://www.amax.network](https://www.amax.network)) is the information aggregation of Armonia ecosystem, where users can get the latest news of Armonia in the first time, download the latest version of Armonia apps, and experience the charm of Armonia apps. It is also the hub of Armonia users and they can email us (service@armoniax.com) with any comments, suggestions, or even criticisms on Armonia. Their support and encouragement are the driving force for Armonia to keep forging ahead, because Armonia and every user are a community of shared future in the era of opportunity.

The times are like the great waves sweeping away sand and each wave pushes at the one ahead. Looking to the future, we have more expecting opportunities waiting for us. In this process, Armonia will always accompany you as the whole ecosystem "space station", and our website ([https://www.amax.network](https://www.amax.network)) will always explore the ocean of stars in the multi-chain universe of blockchain with you.

Let's go together for a shared future!
